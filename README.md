In this folder there is an .ino file along with an .html file which has been compiled using CSS and JavaScript.

In the ino file, I use SPIFFS as data storage in the esp, but it is not included in this folder, because it only contains .txt files.

The .html file is still very basic and the arrangement is not neat, because it is only arranged dynamically without much other structure.
